# CENTO

Our platform, Cento, is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that serves as the home for our cZAR coin, which is pegged to the South African Rand. With Cento, you have the ability to deposit South African Rands from your bank account into our DEX, and in return, the platform will mint the equivalent amount of cZAR based on the deposited Rands. This allows you to easily convert your fiat currency into the cZAR stablecoin.

Once you have cZAR, you can exchange it for any of the stablecoins provided by Mento Labs, as well as CELO. While you can freely send the Mento Labs stablecoins to any wallet of your choice, please note that the cZAR can only be withdrawn into your local bank account through Cento.

In addition to depositing, swapping, and withdrawing funds, Cento offers convenient send and receive options. Specifically, we have implemented a remittance feature that provides NFC-based phone-to-phone and phone-to-card payment options. This innovative functionality eliminates the need for traditional point-of-sale (POS) devices, making transactions seamless and efficient.

To further enhance the user experience, Cento has a rewards program in place. By utilizing our platform to pay or shop with our partners, you can earn rewards and benefits. Notably, on your third transaction with our partners, you will receive a 10% discount, which serves as an incentive to encourage continued usage and generate increased traffic on our platform.

Furthermore, Cento provides staking and liquidity provision options for individuals who wish to contribute to the security and stability of the protocol while earning additional income for themselves.

# Looking ahead
Our future plans involve connecting a USSD feature to cater to the needs of individuals in the African market who utilize feature phones. This feature will ensure accessibility and inclusivity.

Additionally, we are actively working on adding full functionality to Cento, ensuring that all aspects of the platform operate smoothly and effectively.

Moreover, we are developing a feature that will enable mapping addresses to cell numbers, providing users with the convenience of using their cell numbers as a payment option. This feature aims to streamline transactions and simplify the payment process.
